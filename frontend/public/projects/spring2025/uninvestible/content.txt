UNINVESTABLE
Project Description
● UNINVESTABLE is a dual AI business intelligence platform and brokerage platform that assists retail investors in the Chinese markets with a macro focus.
● It utilizes a custom AI business intelligence assistant to translate foreign publications directly and provide relevant forward guidance based on signaled industries.
● It provides company names, corporate structures, and financial information on major foreign companies.
● Its main value proposition lies in the business intelligence offering that is much cheaper than Bloomberg and Capital IQ subscriptions while providing incentives for direct trade execution.
● Furthermore, it would allow for direct equity investments and the option of overriding HKEX minimum stock order requirements once the business scales.

Our Story
The idea for UNINVESTABLE emerged from Kevin Xiong’s personal investing and internship experiences. During a previous bull market, Kevin’s investments in blue chip Chinese stocks outperformed the S&P 500, sparking a deep interest in overseas alpha generation. His time at a securities firm in Beijing exposed the fragmented structure of Chinese markets and the inefficiencies within them—insights that inspired the creation of a more accessible and data-rich investment platform for American retail investors. By blending AI with macro research and trade execution, UNINVESTABLE aims to democratize access to China's equity markets.
Problem We're Solving
This project addresses the information asymmetry that American retail investors face in discovering alpha and trading opportunities in the Chinese markets.
Our Solution
Through AI infrastructure, UNINVESTABLE allows users to gather relevant and bespoke information on companies in the Chinese market. The pricing of $20 per month significantly undercuts Bloomberg and Capital IQ while offering personalized information. Furthermore, it provides in-depth information on market conditions and government publications through web scraping local news platforms and government announcements. By participating in the StockConnect program, this platform allows users to invest directly into the HK, SZ, and SH equity markets. This opens more equities to American retail investors, while clearing systems within the platform will avoid the restrictive minimum lot sizes required by the HKEX.
Market Analysis
● 50 million retail investors in the U.S.
● Growing appetite for macro diversification due to U.S. market volatility
● Retail investors often priced out of U.S. equities or unaware of foreign opportunities
● American investors face barriers like high data costs (Bloomberg, Capital IQ) and limited access to foreign markets
Key Product Features

Lessons Learned & Future Plans
Feasibility is a key aspect of every project—one needs a supportive team to scale complex ideas. It’s also crucial to manage expectations and adapt the project to regulatory realities. While the technical prototype is complete, the legal hurdles for a cross-border brokerage platform are significant. Due to this, the project will likely not continue in the near term.
