Muscle Memory
Project Description
● Many couples struggle to stay consistent with their gym routines due to a lack of motivation or accountability.
● Muscle Memory solves this by encouraging couples to work out together through reward-based incentives.
● The app tracks joint attendance and offers rewards like discounts or free classes for completing “muscle missions”.
● Key features include a home page showing active and completed muscle missions along with earned discounts, a rewards page where users can select new goals, and a tracking feature that verifies gym attendance via check-ins and adds progress to the goal.
● This system fosters teamwork, consistency, and makes fitness a more engaging, goal-driven experience for couples.

Our Story
Both of us enjoy working out and are very familiar with the lack of motivation when it comes to going to the gym. We also know that there are many fitness apps available, yet they all rely on the user’s personal motivation. We wanted to build a solution for people who understand the value of fitness, but have trouble prioritizing it.
Problem We're Solving
Many beginners struggle to maintain a consistent gym routine due to busy schedules, lack of motivation, or limited accountability. Traditional fitness apps are effective when the user has individual motivation, but there is a need for a solution that encourages people to stay committed to their fitness journeys together by rewarding them for their consistency and teamwork.
Our Solution
The solution is an app called Muscle Memory that motivates couples to maintain a consistent gym routine by tracking their joint attendance and rewarding them for meeting shared fitness goals. By partnering with local businesses to provide rewards such as free classes and discounts on purchases as well as leveraging the inherent accountability within relationships, Muscle Memory bridges the motivational gap between starting to work out and seeing progress.
Market Analysis
● 27.5% of adults do not meet recommended physical activity levels.
● 50% of new gym users drop out within 6 months; one-third cancel memberships annually.
● Two-thirds of gym members have memberships but don’t go regularly.
● Only 6% of people with a partner dropped out, compared to 43% without a partner.
Key Product Features
Studies show that app users engage in more fitness activity, especially when gamified. Muscle Memory fills the gap by offering rewards and accountability for couples to stay engaged.

Lessons Learned & Future Plans
Lessons Learned:
● Building a game isn’t as easy as making a fun feature and hoping engagement will follow.
● Building without a clear image of a user in mind leads to many features but no direction.
● Targeting a niche market and designing around a key user problem creates more actionable insights.
Future Work / Next Steps:
● Target couples that are beginner gym-goers for initial adoption.
● Refine reward types and difficulty levels.
● Expand market reach to include general gym-goers as engagement improves.
