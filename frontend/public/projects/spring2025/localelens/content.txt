LocaleLens
Project Description
● LocaleLens is not only a better apartment search platform, it acts as a virtual broker.
● LocaleLens first brings new data to users through apartment listing descriptions, making the apartment search easier than ever before with nuanced, natural language search.
● Then, when a user saves their favorite search terms, LocaleLens acts as a virtual broker by sending notifications to users when new apartment listings get uploaded through our StreetEasy apartment listing access.
● This way, users are the first to know when a potential apartment is available, and it will be exactly what they are looking for, every time.
Key Features
Smart Search
Natural language understanding improves search relevance.
Saved Searches
Users save their preferences to get targeted results.
Real-Time Notifications
Users are alerted instantly when a new match is listed.
StreetEasy Integration
Access thousands of live listings via RapidAPI.
Virtual Broker Experience
The platform proactively serves apartment suggestions based on saved preferences.
Main Feature Showcase
Key visuals include:
● Search bar with different filters
● Results page for different searches
● Account creation page to receive real-time alerts for new apartments, acting like a 24/7 real estate agent
Our Story
We were motivated to pursue this project because of the struggles we faced when finding a new apartment. We’ve both experienced the competitiveness of the apartment hunt, gone on multiple (disappointing) tours, and spent weeks trying to find the best apartment for us.
Problem We're Solving
The NYC apartment search is competitive, time-consuming, and broker fees are expensive.
Our Solution
Smarter search and real-time alerts of new listings that match what NYC renters want give them a head start on their dream apartment with a 'virtual broker.'
Market Analysis
● Target Market: First-time movers to NYC
● Market Size: 1.5 million movers annually, user value estimated at $50 → $75 million
● Competitors: StreetEasy, Zillow, Redfin
● Insight: People prioritize convenience and are willing to pay premiums for time-saving tools.
Key Product Features
● Semantic Search Algorithm – enhances listing relevance
● Real-time Alerts – users stay ahead of the apartment competition
● Saved Search Terms – creates a virtual broker profile to automatically scout listings
Technical Approach
Backend: Google CloudRun, semantic search (Python GitHub repo)
Database: MySQL
APIs: RapidAPI (StreetEasy data)
Frontend: Vercel (Vite + TypeScript + React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn-ui)
Technical Challenges
Effective search functionality required switching between semantic search and ChatGPT-based processing to get the desired speed and relevance. Additionally, developing a modern frontend proved difficult, so the team used new tools such as Lovable and Vercel to deliver a robust and clean user experience.
