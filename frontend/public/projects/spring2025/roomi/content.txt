Our Story
As college seniors preparing to graduate and move to new cities, we are actively thinking about how we are going to find housing with great roommates. That’s what led to the creation of Roomi.
Problem We're Solving
Proactive movers often plan ahead and want a roommate for affordability, safety, companionship, etc., BUT struggle to find someone in their network who is also looking and meets their criteria.
Our Solution
Roomi is a smart roommate-matching platform that connects proactive movers based on what really matters—timing, budget, and neighborhood. For those who want a roommate for affordability, safety, or companionship but can’t find the right match in their network, Roomi makes it easy to connect with compatible people planning a move on the same terms.
Market Analysis
● Shared accommodation market includes Roomster, Craigslist, and Airbnb.
● Roomi is focused specifically on NYC.
● There are about 120K young movers actively seeking roommates in NYC.
Key Product Features
Concise Survey Design
Refined through iterations to include only essential matching questions.
Logistics First
Unlike competitors focused on personality, Roomi matches based on budget, neighborhood, and timeline.
Survey to Match Pipeline
Users complete the Roomi survey and are matched using an Excel-based algorithm.
Technical Approach
Canva: Used to host and create a website.
Jotform: Used for Roomi survey creation.
Excel: Used to track Roomi users and implement a matching algorithm.
ChatGPT: Used to assist with the matching algorithm.
Technical Challenges
A key technical challenge we faced was determining the right parameters for a matching algorithm that accurately reflects user priorities to ensure high-quality, compatible matches in real time. This was especially difficult when we were still focused on personality compatibility, as we had to account for a wide range of lifestyle factors and personal interests—like cleanliness, social habits, sleep schedules, and hobbies—while preventing the algorithm from becoming either too rigid or too lenient.
