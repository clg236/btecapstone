Quitly
Project Description
● Quitly is a habit-breaking app designed to help people quit a bad habit by leveraging the power of group accountability. Quitly focuses on behavior change through social support. Users can join small groups, check in daily to maintain shared streaks, and track their progress on a group leaderboard. Inspired by Atomic Habits and behavioral psychology, Quitly turns quitting from an isolating experience into a shared challenge. By transforming peer pressure into a positive force, Quitly helps users build lasting habits in an environment where progress can be made together.

Our Story
As someone personally working to quit vaping, I understand the challenges of breaking nicotine addiction. Combined with the rising prevalence of vaping among my peers, this project is driven by the need for a fun, engaging, and effective solution that helps others on the same journey.
Problem We're Solving
Quitting is not just a physical challenge — it’s a deeply social and behavioral one. Most quit attempts fail because people try to do it alone, in environments filled with triggers and without consistent support.
Our Solution
Quitly helps people quit smoking by turning it into a shared challenge. Through daily check-ins, group streaks, and leaderboards, it creates a supportive environment where positive peer pressure and accountability drive real behavior change.
Market Analysis
● Inspired by Duolingo’s reward-driven model, Quitly emphasizes fun and accountability for quitting habits.
● Existing tools lack the group element and engaging design that Quitly provides.
Key Product Features
Gamified Behavior Change
Encourages commitment through streaks and group stats.
Atomic Habits-Based Design
Built on the proven principles of behavior change.
Small Group Structure
Fosters trust, motivation, and accountability.
Technical Approach
ChatGPT: Assisted with building logic and structure.
Xcode: Tried for iOS version but faced challenges.
Replit: Early experimentation for backend functions.
Technical Challenges
There were many technical challenges along the way. Initially, I created a demo page through Python and tried to set up a backend with Firebase. I got stuck on making the page interactive and including the features I desired. Then I tried to use Xcode for an iOS app, but it didn’t display the demo properly. I eventually settled on an AI platform that let me generate the demo I wanted.
