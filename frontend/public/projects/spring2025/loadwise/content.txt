The LoadWise dashboard provides athletes with a comprehensive view of their training load, fatigue levels, and personalized recommendations in an easy-to-understand interface.
Our Story
The idea for LoadWise was born when Ben Trask and Conor Kelly, both seniors at NYU Stern with a passion for sports and fitness, identified a significant gap in the tools available to inexperienced marathon runners and triathletes. Through extensive research and user feedback, they developed a platform that addresses the challenge of training optimization and injury prevention. The development process involved iterative prototyping based on constant user feedback, resulting in a platform that's both powerful and intuitive. LoadWise is designed to make a meaningful impact for athletes who lack access to sophisticated training management tools.
Problem We're Solving
Marathon runners lack accessible tools to track cumulative workload and personalized help to make data-informed decisions about training intensity and recovery, which can lead to overtraining and injury.
Our Solution
LoadWise integrates with Strava and Apple Health, analyzes real-time training load, provides actionable, personalized rest & training suggestions, and tracks injury risk using proven load algorithms.

Lessons Learned & Future Plans
Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of the struggles that competitive runners face due to the lack of accessible tools. We realized the power of AI tools like ChatGPT and Windsurf co-pilot in app development, even with limited experience. We plan to continue exploring how we can expand this project and integrate tools specifically designed for triathletes.
