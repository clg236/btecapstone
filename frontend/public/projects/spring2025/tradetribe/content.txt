TradeTribe
Project Description
● TradeTribe is an emotional training platform for beginner student options traders, designed to build discipline and reduce impulsive trading behavior through structured trade logging, emotional check-ins, and AI-powered feedback.
● Instead of focusing on execution like most trading tools, TradeTribe targets emotional triggers—such as FOMO, revenge trading, and overconfidence—that often cause beginners to lose money and quit.
● Users simulate trades on platforms like TradingView, then return to TradeTribe to log decisions and complete pre- and post-trade emotional check-ins.
● The platform’s AI analyzes user responses, assigns a Readiness Score (0–100), and delivers personalized feedback to help traders recognize patterns and improve emotional control over time.
● Built on Glide, TradeTribe is pioneering emotional intelligence as a core component of trading education—aiming to become the “Strava for trading discipline.”

Our Story
TradeTribe was born from firsthand experience with the emotional highs and lows of trading. I battled with emotional discipline—and honestly, I’m still working on it. I wiped out my starter capital not due to strategy, but due to emotional triggers. That’s when I realized—success in the markets isn’t just about strategy, it’s about mindset. That’s what TradeTribe is here to train.
Problem We're Solving
Over 90% of beginner options traders lose their capital within the first 3 months—not due to a lack of knowledge, but because of emotional triggers. Most trading platforms focus on execution and market access, offering little to no support for managing the psychological side of trading. Without emotional awareness tools, new traders repeat mistakes, lose confidence, and quit before ever developing the discipline needed for long-term success.
Our Solution
Our solution is an emotional trading platform where beginner student options traders build discipline and confidence through structured trade logging and AI-powered feedback. Users complete guided pre- and post-trade emotional check-ins, log trade details, and receive a personalized Readiness Score that evolves over time. Integrated with TradingView for simulated trades, TradeTribe helps users identify patterns like impulsiveness, hesitation, and revenge trading—turning emotional awareness into a consistent, growth-oriented habit.

● Build a more transparent scoring system that shows users how their Readiness Score evolves.
● Integrate with more trading platforms beyond TradingView.
● Add data visualizations to show emotional trends over weeks and months.
● Launch a small trading program to test growth and user feedback.
